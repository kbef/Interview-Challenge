# Interview-Challenge
2-4 hour challenge:

Build a web based image picking tool using the unsplash.com API.

Using modern vanilla javascript, build a simple web interface that allows me to type in a word or two and see a selection of relevant images from unsplash (via their API). When I find an image that I like allow me to set that image as the background image for the web interface.

I ask that you not use jquery for this task but rather just use modern javascript APIs (assume I am running the latest public release of Chrome).

You will be evaluated on your use of javascript to interact with the unsplash API, your ability to make decisions and reasonable assumptions without a lot of direction, and the overall code quality of your work, and the quality of your git commit history.

Please commit this to a public github repository and commit regularly and often. I will evaluate the git commit history.

I suspect this won’t take a long time but please don’t take longer than 4 hours to complete (I don’t want to waste your time). If you find that it goes quicker than you expect, use your discretion to add some nice extra “features” that showcase your skills (again, please try to create a nice git commit history that I can evaluate)

Some stretch goal ideas:
* persist the history of background changes in local storage so that I can see my past selections when I come back to the site
* allow me to choose from a small selection of instagram like filters before setting as background
